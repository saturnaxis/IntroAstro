    "Planets hold onto their atmosphere through their own gravity.  We can estimate a planet's ability to hold onto its atmosphere by comparing the average speed of particles in a gas to the escape velocity from the planet (see [4.2.2](https://saturnaxis.github.io/IntroAstro/Tutorials/gravity-and-orbits.html#escape-velocity)).  The escape velocity is given as\n",
