    "The light-gathering power of a telescope is proportional to the **area** $A$ of its lens or mirror.  Such optics are constructed as thin or thick *cylinder* because it's easier to even out the glass or metal by using the centripetal force from spinning.  It is eaiser measure the **aperture** (diameter) of a lens or mirror because you don't need to locate the exact center.  As a result, we use the area of a circle but substitute for the radius using the diameter ($r = D/2$) to get\n",
