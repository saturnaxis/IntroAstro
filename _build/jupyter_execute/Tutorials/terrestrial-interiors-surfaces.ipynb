    "Some elements are radioactive, which means that a parent element decays into a daughter element plus and a much smaller particle is ejected.  Scientists can quantify the decay process by measuring the ratio of the final amount $P_F$ to the original amount $P_o$ of the parent elements, or $P_F/P_o$.  This ratio changes over time as more of the parent elements decay into daughter elements.  The *time it takes* for half of the orignal amount to decay is called the **half-life**.  \n",

    "The most abundant isotope of uranium is U-238, which decays through a series of intermediate daughters to an isotope of lead (Pb-206).  The half-life of U-238 is 4.5 billion years.  Therefore, after 4.5 billion years, a sample that originally contained only U-238 and no Pb-206 would be found with equal numbers of both U-238 and Pb-206.  If we found a mineral with such a composition, we would know that the mineral crystallized (i.e., formed) 4.5 billion years ago.\n",
