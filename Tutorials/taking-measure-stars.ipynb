    "A star's [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax) is a measure of how much (in angle) it moves on the sky relative to a baseline distance.  For stars, we typically use the distance from the Earth to the Sun ($1\\ {\\rm AU}$) as the baseline.  Thus, we define the parallax angle $p$ as:\n",

    "The parallax angle $p$ must be measured in arcseconds, which makes the proportion an equality and gives us a distance in **parsec** $(\\text{pc})$.  A parsec can be converted into a **light-year** $({\\rm ly})$ through the conversion factor: $1\\ {\\rm pc} = 3.26\\ {\\rm ly}$.\n",

    "After the Sun, the next-closest star to the Earth is [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri).  Proxima is a faint member of the triple-star system Alpha Centauri (only confirmed as a member in 2016).  Due to New Horizon's, we have an impressively measured parallax of $0.7685$ arcseconds.  **How far away is Proxima Centauri (in ly)?**\n",

This means that an arcescond is $1/3600$ (or $0.0027\\%$) of the width of your pinky.  The movement of the closest star due to parallax is smaller than that.  It's no wonder that the ancients were believed in geocentrism for so long, since stellar parallax couldn't be measured.\n",
